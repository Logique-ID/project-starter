# Git staged changes changelog (2026-01-09 09:19Z)

Gather detail and information on git staged changes, then write changelog based on it?

The user wants me to gather information about git staged changes and then write a changelog based on those changes. Let me first check what's staged in git by looking at the terminal or running git commands.

Since I'm in ask mode, I can only use read-only tools. Let me check the terminal file to see if there's any git information there, and also try to understand the project structure to see what changes might be staged.

Let me start by checking the terminal output and also look at the git status if possible.</details></think>

---

I'll gather information about the git staged changes to help write the changelog.

The terminal output shows the result of running `mason make starter` - this appears to be a Mason brick project for generating Flutter project starters. The terminal shows many files being created as part of the brick generation.

However, I need to check the actual git staged changes. The terminal doesn't show git status or git diff. I need to look at the project more carefully to understand what the staged changes might be.

Let me look at the brick.yaml to understand what this project does, and also search for any git-related info. Since I'm in read-only mode, I can't run git commands directly, but I can try to understand the project structure.

Let me also look at the src directory more carefully since that's where the brick source code is.</details></think>

---

I can see this is a Mason brick project (Flutter project starter template). The terminal shows `mason make starter` was run, but I don't see git staged changes in the terminal output. Let me examine the project structure more closely to understand the brick template and look for any git-related information.

I can see this is a Mason brick project for generating Flutter starter projects. The brick version is 0.1.0+1. Now I understand the project but I need to check what the staged changes are. 

Since I'm in read-only mode, I can't run `git diff --staged` or `git status` to see the staged changes. Let me see if there's any other way to find out what's staged, or if there's a .git folder I can inspect.

Actually, looking at the project structure and the README/brick.yaml, this appears to be the initial release of the project (0.1.0+1). The features include:

1. Flavors: Development, Staging, and Production environments
2. State Management: Riverpod 3.0.3 with code generation
3. Routing: GoRouter 17.0.0
4. Local Database: Sembast with encryption
5. HTTP Client: Dio with Alice debugging
6. Firebase: Core, Messaging, and FlutterFire CLI configuration
7. Responsive Design: Flutter ScreenUtil
8. Localization: English and Indonesian
9. Custom app icons and splash support via brick variables
10. Post-generation hooks for Firebase configuration and icon/splash generation

Let me check if there are any hooks that might give more details about the brick's functionality.</details></think>

Let me examine the hooks and more details to understand all the features of this brick template:

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of this Mason brick project. This is the initial release (0.1.0+1) of a Flutter starter brick.

Since I'm in read-only mode, I cannot run `git diff --staged` or `git status` to see the actual staged changes. I should let the user know that I need to switch to agent mode to access git commands, or they can provide the git staged changes.

However, based on all the information I've gathered about the project, I can write a comprehensive changelog for the initial release. The brick version is 0.1.0+1, which suggests this is the first release.

Let me compile the features:

**Core Features:**
1. **Flavors** - Development (dev), Staging (stg), and Production (prod) environment support via flutter_flavorizr
2. **State Management** - Riverpod 3.0.3 with code generation (riverpod_generator)
3. **Routing** - GoRouter 17.0.0 with shell routes
4. **Local Database** - Sembast 3.8.5+2 with encryption support (encrypt, crypto packages)
5. **HTTP Client** - Dio 5.9.0 with Alice debugging

**Firebase Integration:**
- Firebase Core 4.2.1
- Firebase Messaging 16.0.4
- FlutterFire CLI auto-configuration via shell script for all flavors

**UI & Design:**
- Responsive design with Flutter ScreenUtil 5.9.3
- Custom app icons via flutter_launcher_icons 0.14.4
- Native splash screen via flutter_native_splash 2.4.7
- Google Fonts 6.3.2
- SVG support via flutter_svg 2.2.2

**Forms:**
- flutter_form_builder 10.2.0
- form_builder_validators 11.2.0

**Localization:**
- English and Indonesian support


- Using Flutter's built-in localization

**Project Structure:**
- Feature-based architecture with pre-configured VSCode settings and launch configurations
- Cursor IDE rules for project structure and Flutter UI patterns

**Mason Hooks:**
- Pre-generation prompts for Firebase project ID, custom icon path, and splash path
- Post-generation automation including Kotlin package directory creation, FlutterFire configuration, and launcher icon/splash generation

Now I can propose a changelog to the user.</details></think>

I can see this is a Mason brick project (Flutter project starter template) at version **0.1.0+1**. However, I'm in read-only mode and cannot run `git diff --staged` or `git status` to see the actual staged changes.

To properly write the changelog based on staged changes, please **switch to Agent mode** so I can run git commands to inspect the staged files.

That said, based on my analysis of the codebase, here's a comprehensive changelog for the **initial release** (0.1.0+1) that you can use:
